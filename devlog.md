### [2025-07-13] - Health System Implementation
**Status**: ✅ Working

**What was changed:**
- Created comprehensive health system with Health class (`classes/health.py`)
- Health range: 0-100 with 20% increment status flags (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Critical, Dead)
- Multiple factors affecting health: food consumption, rest quality, weather exposure, conditions, medicine
- Individual death mechanics with game-over condition when all party members die
- Added Party class (`classes/party.py`) for managing multiple travelers
- Updated Person class to integrate health system with profession-based health bonuses
- Added health bonuses to professions.json (Doctor: +10, Farmer: +5, Solo Traveler: -10, etc.)

**What works:**
- ✅ Health status tracking with clear categories every 20 points
- ✅ Daily health updates based on food, rest, weather, and conditions
- ✅ Starvation effects (malnutrition condition after 2 days, progressive health loss)
- ✅ Weather exposure damage with sickness chances
- ✅ Medicine treatment system with condition curing
- ✅ Health conditions (Sick, Exhausted, Malnourished, Feverish, etc.) with duration timers
- ✅ Individual death mechanics and party management
- ✅ Game over detection when all party members die
- ✅ Profession-based health differences (Doctor survives longest, Solo Traveler most vulnerable)
- ✅ Natural healing for healthy individuals
- ✅ Comprehensive daily reporting and party status tracking

**What doesn't work:**
- No issues found in testing - all core functionality working as designed

**Next steps:**
- Integrate health system with existing inventory/food spoilage system
- Add health system to main game loop
- Consider adding more specific medicine types
- Add disease outbreak events
- Integrate with planned event system

**Files modified:**
- `classes/health.py` (created) - Core health system logic
- `classes/party.py` (created) - Party management with health integration
- `classes/person.py` (updated) - Integrated health system with Person class
- `data/professions.json` (updated) - Added health_bonus for each profession
- `health_demo.py` (created) - Comprehensive testing and demonstration

### [2025-07-13] - Comprehensive Code Documentation
**Status**: ✅ Working

**What was changed:**
- Added extensive comments to all class files for new programmers
- Explained syntax, logic, and programming concepts throughout the codebase
- Added detailed docstrings with parameter explanations and return types
- Commented complex logic like dictionary operations, loops, and conditionals
- Explained Python-specific concepts like f-strings, list comprehensions, enums, etc.

**What works:**
- ✅ All classes now have beginner-friendly documentation
- ✅ Comments explain both WHAT the code does and WHY
- ✅ Syntax explanations for Python features (dictionaries, list comprehensions, etc.)
- ✅ Function parameters and return types clearly documented
- ✅ Complex logic broken down into understandable steps
- ✅ Programming concepts explained inline (loops, conditionals, error handling)

**What doesn't work:**
- No issues found - all documentation successfully added

**Next steps:**
- Consider adding example usage comments to key methods
- May want to add type hints for even better documentation
- Could create a "Getting Started" guide for new contributors

**Files modified:**
- `classes/health.py` (extensive commenting throughout)
- `classes/person.py` (comprehensive documentation added)
- `classes/inventory.py` (detailed explanations for all methods)
- `classes/item.py` (beginner-friendly comments added)
- `classes/wagon.py` (syntax and logic explanations added)

## 💡 Ideas & Notes

This section is for random ideas, architectural thoughts, or reminders:

- Consider using a state machine pattern for game phases (preparation, travel, events, etc.)
- Event system could benefit from a priority/weight system for random selection
- Inventory spoilage might need different rates for different food types
- Solo Traveler profession needs special handling in many systems
