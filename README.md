# 🐂 Oregon Trail Parody Game (Work in Progress)

> ⚠️ **NOTE:** This is an independent, personal project currently in development. It is not part of any school curriculum or assignment. It’s a fun way for me to sharpen my programming skills while exploring game design ideas inspired by classic educational games.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a **text-based parody of *The Oregon Trail***, written in **Python** and built using **GitHub Codespaces**. It’s designed to be both nostalgic and educational, providing a playful experience that mimics the original game’s challenges—like managing resources, surviving harsh conditions, and making tough choices on the trail—but with custom twists and features inspired by modern gameplay mechanics and accessibility needs.

The game will feature:

- Turn-based simulation gameplay
- Random events and outcomes
- Profession-based character bonuses and penalties
- Inventory management
- Wagon upgrades and tradeoffs
- Health and survival mechanics
- Possibilities for future GUI integration using Tkinter or web technologies

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Practice **object-oriented programming** in Python
- Gain experience with **version control**, **modular design**, and **project structuring**
- Develop and apply **game logic and event systems**
- Build towards future projects that explore **accessibility and inclusive game design**, especially for children with different learning needs

## 🧩 Key Features (Planned)

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧍 Professions | Choose from roles like **Banker**, **Farmer**, **Carpenter**, **Doctor**, and **Solo Traveler**, each with unique traits |
| 🚙 Wagons | Pick from **Basic**, **Standard**, or **Deluxe** wagons, each with different capacity, durability, and repair difficulty |
| 🎒 Inventory System | Manage supplies like food, clothing, medicine, ammo—some items will wear out or spoil |
| 💀 Risk and Survival | Face disease, injury, weather, and breakdowns. Your party's fate depends on your planning and choices |
| 🗺️ Progression | Move west across a randomized route with trail events and survival choices |
| 🧠 Accessibility Concepts | Design choices inspired by inclusive gameplay and cognitive simplicity for broader audiences |

## 💬 Why I’m Building This

As a parent of an autistic child, I’m deeply interested in how technology—especially games—can support different learning styles. This project is a stepping stone toward building more inclusive and meaningful interactive experiences in the future. It’s also a way to practice Python and project planning in a creative context.
